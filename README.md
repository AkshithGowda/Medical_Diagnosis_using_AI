# Medical_Diagnosis_using_AI
This project implements a machine learning-based diabetes prediction model using Support Vector Machine (SVM). The model is trained on a dataset containing health parameters such as glucose levels, BMI, and blood pressure. A Streamlit web application is developed for user-friendly interaction, allowing users to input their health data and receive a diabetes risk prediction.

Features
Machine Learning Model: Uses SVM for classification.

User-Friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit for easy interaction.

Data Processing: Preprocessed health data for accurate predictions.

Visualization: Graphical representation of input parameters and predictions.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Sklearn, Pandas, NumPy, Streamlit, Matplotlib

Dataset: Public diabetes dataset
